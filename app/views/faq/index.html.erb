					<a href="#">What Is Greenir?</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body" id="collapseOne">Greenir is the only marketplace for 100% renewable electricity for your home or apartment.	If you’re in one of the 24 deregulated energy markets in the US <span style="color: #5cb85c;">(Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia)</span>, you have a choice when it comes to who provides you with your electricity. There are a lot of utility companies that offer electricity plans with different terms and price points, but we focus on the ones that offers electricity sourced from 100% renewable methods (solar, wind, hydro).</div>

			</div>


			<div class="accordion-group">
				<div class='heading' data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseTwo">
					<a href="#">Why Switch?</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseTwo">We believe that there is a huge information gap in that most people don't know that they have a choice when it comes to their electricity supplier, and even fewer know that there are renewable energy options out there! We are hoping to bridge that gap and provide our customers with the opportunity to decrease their carbon footprints and invest in the future of renewable energy.</div>
			</div>


			<!-- <div class="accordion-group">
				<div class="heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThree">
					<a href="#">Hmm, This Sounds Pretty Sweet! Why Are You Guys Doing This?</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseThree">Glad you think so! There are a couple of reasons why we wanted to start Greenir. Like many others, we are concerned about the environment, our reliability on “dirty” methods of energy production, and are excited that we are truly at the point in time when supplying your home with renewable electricity is easy and affordable! We also think that there is a HUGE gap information regarding your ability to choose an energy supplier. We believe that if more people knew that they could switch to 100% green electricity, that we’d see a sharp increase in renewable electricity demand and, in result, further investment into renewable technology and R&D.</div>

				<a name="switching" style="text-decoration: none;"><div class="heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseFour">
					<a href="#">What Are You Guys Getting Out Of This?</a>
				</div></a>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseFour">We are pretty straightforward about our business model and revenue stream. We take a commission on every new customer we bring to our utility partners. <b>This commission is paid by the utility company, not the consumer and all prices you see from Greenir are the same prices our utility partners provide to the public directly.</b></div>

			<h1>Switching Electricity Providers</h1>

			<div class="accordion-group">
				<div class="heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseFive">
					<a href="#">How Do I Know If I Am Eligable To Switch Plans?</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseFive">If you live in a deregulated energy market (see above), and currently pay your utility company directly (vs. paying your building or a landlord), you have the right to select your electricity providers –it’s that simple!</div>

			</div>

			<div class="accordion-group">
				<div class="heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseSix">
					<a href="#">Fixed vs. Variable Packages</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseSix">Electricity providers generally offer both fixed and varaible packages. Fixed rates means that your cost will not change for the duration of your contract, while variable rate packages generally fluctuate in price based on demand and use. Generally, we suggest that if you are a home or apartment renter, that you choose a variable package, but if you own your home, condo, or apartment, you should consider some fixed rate packages as they make it easier to plan your budget.</div>

			</div>


			<div class="accordion-group">
				<div class="heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThirteen">
					<a href="#">How Should I Choose A Package?</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseThirteen">All of our utility partners have been vetted for reliability and dedication to green energy, so we stand by each and every package listed on our site. In terms of deciding which utility/package you want to go with, we suggest reviewing your current electricity spend/kWh and compare it to the current prices of packages listed on our site. All of the packages we feature are sourced from 100% renewable sources, but if you are interested, we provide detailed explanations of the method of energy extraction (solar, wind, hydro) used by each of our partners, so we suggest checking that out once you enter your zip!</div>

			<div class="accordion-group">
				<div class="heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseSeven">
					<a href="#">So How Do I Know These Green Energy Guys Are Reliable? What If My Power Goes Out?</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseSeven">Regardless of which utility company you choose, your electricity will continue to be delivered to your home or apartment by the same local company who currently owns and maintains the electricity lines. If there is a power outage, your electricity will return at the same time as your neighbor’s who may not be a Greenir customer. When you select a package on Greenir, you are specifying the method in which your electricity was generated, not the delivery method, <b>so there should be no concerns about potential blackouts</b></div>

			</div>

			<div class="accordion-group">
				<div class="heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseEight">
					<a href="#">Well, I’m Convinced! What Happens Once I've Made The Switch To Green Energy?</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseEight">In terms of your day to day, not much is going to change. Once you provide us with your information, your new supplier will handle the transition for you. This will take about 2-4 weeks, but there will be no interuptions in service during this time. You will still receive the same bill, but the supply itself will come from your new utility company!</div>

<!-- 			<div class="accordion-group">
				<div class="heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseNine">
					<a href="#">Why Are There No Green Energy Options In My Area?</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseNine">For right now, Greenir is only operating in New York. As we continue to grow as a company and increase our utility partner network, we will expand into the other deregulated electricity markets. If you’d like to be notified when we come to your area, feel free to <a href=”#”>join our email list</a></div>

				<div class="heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseTen">
					<a href="#">Will I Save Money?</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseTen">It's definitely possible! Just like your current electricity rates (if you're on a variable plan), prices change regularly.  We've found that the majority of the packages that we offer hover around the same price as your state's default electricity provider, with the added benefit of being green! So don't be surprised if you end up saving some cash here and there, but the real goal here is to provide you with a high-quality, renewable electricity source to power your home.</div>

					<a href="#">How Will I Be Billed?</a>
				</div>
					<div class="accordion-body collapse" id="collapseEleven">Your payments will still be made to your electricity supplier as you normally would, but you'll notice a change on the supply side of the bill in that your electricity is now comming from a new source</div>

			</div>

				<div class="heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseFourteen">
